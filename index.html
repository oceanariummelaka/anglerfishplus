<p><h2>Anglerfish fun fact</h2><br> The deep sea is always very dark, as light from the sun doesn’t reach down there. So, some species of anglerfish produce their own source of light, from the end of their illicium. This is called bioluminescence and can be used as a method of attracting both mates and prey.<br> Anglerfish produce light through symbiotic bacteria. However, scientists still don’t entirely know what biological mechanisms anglerfish used to acquire these bacteria. It’s commonly thought, however, that the bacteria are absorbed from the seawater through the illicium.</p>
